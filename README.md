## Image Pre-processing for Text Detection and OCR with Python
 > - Project Description: The "Image Pre-processing for Text Detection and OCR with Python" project showcases essential pre-processing techniques to enhance the quality of images before performing Optical Character Recognition (OCR). This project demonstrates how to use Python and OpenCV to apply various pre-processing methods, such as grayscale conversion, thresholding, color inversion, resizing, morphological operations, and noise removal. The improved images can then be fed into an OCR engine, such as Tesseract, for accurate text extraction.
